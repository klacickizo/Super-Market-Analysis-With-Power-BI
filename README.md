# Super-Market-Analysis-With-Power-BI

Power BI is one of the robust tools a Data Analyst should have in his arsenal. In this project i made use to Power Bi to Analyze the Super Market Dataset. I showed great masstery of the components in Power BI to draw insights as shown in the Dashboard. This was Project for Aptlearn.

I made use of Power Query to load the Dataset.
Then i proceeded to clean and Manipulate the dataset to prepare it for the analysis.
